# 90s marketplace

The goal of this task is to test your ability to test, refactor and implement new functionality on a given system. Note
that this repository does not represent the actual code of CGTrader, but only acts as a testing ground.

## Tasks

1. Make sure test suite runs through all of the tests successfully
2. Implement MVP cart functionality
3. Refactor implementation code and tests where you see fit. You have as much freedom here as you wish.

## Notes & Requirements

* Try not to spend more than 4 hours on this task. This will constrain you not to spend too much time on trivial
details (sometimes you have to make compromises in order to deliver fast).
* Use git to track your changes.
* Fork this repository, when finished, send us the link to it or simply zip the project and send it via e-mail.

Good luck!
